#ShoutOut Version 1.0.0 02/03/17

GENERAL INFORMATION
-------------------
ShoutOut is a web application that aims to solve the problem of asking
anonymous questions in lectures. To make it fast and easy to use there is no
need for either the teacher or the student to sign up.

INSTALLATION
------------
If you have a working web browser, there is no need to install anything.

USAGE
------
The web application is split in two views; the teacher and the student. The
teacher starts by making a new lecture with a name, e.g. TDT4140. The students
join the lecture by writing in the name.

In the teachers view of the lecture, questions appear in real-time when the
students publish them and the teacher can also see the number of votes cast by
other students on each question. If the teacher answers the question, they can
remove it from their view.

In the students view of the lecture, questions also appear in real-time and
students can vote on each other’s question by clicking the voting button. When
the teacher answers a question, the question is marked "Answered".
